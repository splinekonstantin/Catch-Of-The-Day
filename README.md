# Catch-Of-The-Day

A fiction seafood store with bi-directional data flow and live state editing, animated React components and component validation with PropTypes. Uses firebase for storing data samples and for authentication. Uses Localstorage for storing your order. 

Made by following @wesbos's course 'React for beginners'.

Uses: **ReactJS, Stylus, CSS, Webpack, Firebase**.

In this project I learned how React works, how to use Firebase, how to deploy my projects to Now and Netlify.
